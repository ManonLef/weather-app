# Weather APP notes

## Project Requirements

- [ ] toggle Fahrenheit or Celsius
- [ ] change the look of the page bases on the data
- [ ] use Promises or Async/Await in the code 
- [ ] add a form that lets users input their location

## 2023-05-22 I

- I set up my repo using [the template I created a few weeks aga](https://github.com/ManonLef/webpack-eslint-prettier)
- I will postpone the style loader until a bit later to not bloat the setup immediately and see how it works.
- added the build command to package.json. Might consider adding this to the template so you can use the `npm run build` command:
```
"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "build": "webpack"
},
```
- can do the same as above for `watch` with adding `"watch": "webpack --watch"`

## 2023-05-22 II

- I set up some basic functions to get the location based data for the current weather but now I need to start planning to:
  - decide which data I'm actually going to display to store inside an object
  - plan out modules and I think this will be similar to the to-do list (MVC) where model will deal with the API, view with UI and controller with user clicks and such

## 2023-05-22 III Planning ideas
- Main Elements (checked available in API):
  - Location data
    - Location name
    - Country
  - Current Weather
    - Current Condition (check different ones on their site)
      - This is where I'll base the background on. Probably with a switch/case. 
      - Conditions available: [found here](https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/weather_conditions.json) from [the docs](https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/#weather-icons)
    - Temperature
    - Wind direction
    - Wind strength
    - possible air quality
  - Forecast
    - Forecast for today (is available in current weather call as well)
    - decide on amount of days (if possible to get >3 since I came across a discord post this was limited for the free API plan)
    - 
  - Location input
  - Temperature Unit toggle

### Notes:
- the condition  features icons

## Inspiration (things I thought of building or doing while working on this project)
- Future App idea; create a METAR/TAF weather project for aviation

## To-do's
- [ ] 2023-05-22 look into free API options available for forecast
- [ ] 2023-05-22 pseudocode/plan
- [ ] 2023-05-22 store all the info I actually want to use in one object
- [ ] 2023-05-22 at the end of project please make sure to credit WeatherAPI.com [instructions](https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/#credit)
