# Weather APP notes

## Project Requirements

- [ ] toggle Fahrenheit or Celsius
- [ ] change the look of the page bases on the data
- [ ] use Promises or Async/Await in the code 
- [ ] add a form that lets users input their location

## 2023-05-22 I

- I set up my repo using [the template I created a few weeks aga](https://github.com/ManonLef/webpack-eslint-prettier)
- I will postpone the style loader until a bit later to not bloat the setup immediately and see how it works.
- added the build command to package.json. Might consider adding this to the template so you can use the `npm run build` command:
```
"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "build": "webpack"
},
```
- can do the same as above for `watch` with adding `"watch": "webpack --watch"`

## 2023-05-22 II

- I set up some basic functions to get the location based data for the current weather but now I need to start planning to:
  - decide which data I'm actually going to display to store inside an object
  - plan out modules and I think this will be similar to the to-do list (MVC) where model will deal with the API, view with UI and controller with user clicks and such

## To-do's
- [ ] 2023-05-22 look into free API options available for forecast
- [ ] 2023-05-22 pseudocode/plan
